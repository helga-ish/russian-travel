                    According to polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their vacation in their native country. What haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. And you can see all these beauties without millions in your account, passports and hours-long flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova - a brave young mother who took three children in a handful, put them in her "Lada" and drove 20 thousand kilometers across her homeland. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.

The atmosphere of the area eliminates the hustle and bustle, plunging you into the tranquility of nature and the smell of the steely, cool sea.</p>

First of all because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes covered with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places - the mountain air.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph-text">The climate in Altai is moderate, so it is best to come here in summer. This way you will see all the variety of local flora and fauna. Elk roam the Altai forests, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manulas are also inhabitants of the Altai region.</p>

                        <p class="place__paragraph-text">Of course, that's all true. But Baikal is also an ideal place for skijoring competitions. This is a sport where a skier ties himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019, a world record of 197.011 km/h was set at the Baikal Mile festival.</p>

But here it grows up to 30 meters - the forests of Karelian national parks have never known an axe because of impassable bogs. Some pine trees are more than half a millennium old. Touch a living creature that saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it. In a virgin forest, you won't find a trail for a hundred kilometers. And on the rare paths, trees a couple of meters off the ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss.</p>
